        <h2>Meet the Adorable Cape Rain Frog!</h2>
        <p>
          Ever heard of a frog that can't jump or swim? Meet the Cape rain frog
          (Breviceps gibbosus), an adorable little creature native to South
          Africa's southwestern Cape. This pudgy amphibian was first described
          by Carl Linnaeus in 1758 and is also known as the giant rain frog.
